# Money Transfer

## What is this application?

This Money Transfer app is like a bank app that displays the user's current balance and has features such as transferring money, requesting a loan, and closing the account.

## How does this app work?

First of all, the user needs to log in using the **initials** of their **name** and the **PIN**.
Currently, there are four users:-

1- Shivam Chaudhary (1111)
2- Udit Singh (2222)
3- Tushar Rathi (3333)
4- Mradul Tripathi (4444)

So, for example, if **Shivam Chaudhary** wants to log in, he has to write **SC** in place of the username and **1111** in place of the PIN, and similarly for the other users.

Once the user is logged in, they are shown the current balance in their account.
They can transfer money to other accounts using **recipient's initials** and the amount they want to send.
They can also request a loan with the condition that there must be at least one transaction in their account that is at least **10%** of the requested amount.
They can also close their account by entering the same initials used during login and the same PIN.
